# UW Course Notes
I typeset some of the (originally handwritten) notes I take in lectures, and I figured I might as well share them publicly as well. These notes are a combination of what was written on the board as well as things the professor said verbally.

**If you want to stay up-to-date with the latest notes I've posted, bookmark [cthomson.ca/notes](http://cthomson.ca/notes).** You can also take a look at the original LaTeX files in this repository (in case you're curious, want to fix something, or want to extend the notes in some way).

I'd greatly appreciate reports of any typos and factual errors you find. [Open an issue](https://github.com/christhomson/lecture-notes/issues/new) if you find something that should be fixed.

For the nerds: I made [Noteface](https://github.com/christhomson/noteface) to compile and distribute these LaTeX documents, without having to commit the PDF files to the repository.

## Disclaimer
I'm trying to make these notes as accurate as possible, however there might be some errors from things I've heard or seen incorrectly. If you're taking any of these courses, please rely on your own notes. Also, note that the format and content of a course can change drastically from term to term, or even between professors.

## License
You can do what you want with these notes with two restrictions: you may not profit from them in any way, and you must leave my name in them somewhere. Don't be evil. Thanks! :)
