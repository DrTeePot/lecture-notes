# UW Course Notes
In Winter 2013, I decided to start typesetting all of the notes I take during lectures (with LaTeX).

These notes are a combination of what was written on the board as well as things the professor said verbally.

If you simply want to view the notes, [look at the PDFs](http://cthomson.ca/notes). I've also included the original LaTeX files here if you're curious or if you'd like to extend the notes in some way.

I'd greatly appreciate reports of any typos and factual errors you find. [Open an issue](https://github.com/christhomson/lecture-notes/issues/new) if you find something that should be fixed.

## Courses
### 3A - Fall 2013:
* [CS 360 - Introduction to the Theory of Computing](http://noteface.cthomson.ca/dl/latest/cs360.pdf)

### 2B - Winter 2013:
* [CS 240 - Data Structures and Data Management](http://noteface.cthomson.ca/dl/latest/cs240.pdf) (I personally don't like my notes for this course very much.)
* [CS 241 - Foundations of Sequential Programs](http://noteface.cthomson.ca/dl/latest/cs241.pdf)
* [MATH 239 - Introduction to Combinatorics](http://noteface.cthomson.ca/dl/latest/math239.pdf)
* [PSYCH 207 - Cognitive Processes](http://noteface.cthomson.ca/dl/latest/psych207.pdf)
* ~~CS 251 - Computer Organization and Design~~ (Not covered because the slides and printed course notes seem more than sufficient.)

## Disclaimer
I'm trying to make these notes as accurate as possible, however there might be some errors from things I've heard or seen incorrectly. If you're taking any of these courses, please rely on your own notes. Also, note that the format and content of a course can change drastically from term to term, or even between professors.

## License
You can do what you want with these notes with two restrictions: you may not profit from them in any way, and you must leave my name in them somewhere. Don't be evil. Thanks! :)
